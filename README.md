I’m an experienced front-end developer specializing in React and TypeScript. I have a strong focus on writing clean, testable code, ensuring reliability through both unit and integration tests. Over the years, I’ve led and designed projects from scratch, and have experience writing deployment code and managing front-end deployment pipelines.
